## **Problem:**

You are required to develop a **simple one page web map** to display the [Combined Drought Indicator (**CDI**](https://droughtwatch.icpac.net/drought-indicators/cdi/)) layer for the year `2022`.

**The web map should:**

1. Allow users to select the dates they want to visualize for the layer. See question 1 below for details
2. Allow users to click on the map, and get a time series visualization of the CDI values for the clicked point. See question 2 for details.

**Preffered technologies**

- React JS as the UI library
- [Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/guides/) or [Mapbox Libre GL](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js) as the web mapping library

Our web maps mostly use the above technologies. However, if you are not comfortable with any of them, you can use any other framework/library/plain JS, to your liking.
